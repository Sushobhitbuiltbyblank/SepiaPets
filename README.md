# SepiaPets
This is an app that I have created to shows the latest pets list based on local Json file using Swift and Uikit. In this project we have two screens, one is to show the list of pets base on some local json. and second is detail screen of webview which show the content of url present on "pets_json" file of selected pet on main list screen.

This project was made for fun to try out Config json file and see how it possible to restrict the user to show the content based on the working hour time range.

## Concepts
In this Project I have used coordinate desing pattern and mvvm achitecture to demostrate my code practice.
I use the protocol oriented prgramming to achive loosely coupling in code.

## Platforms
Task app will currently run from iOS 15.5+.
This app is updated for Xcode 13.4.1+ . I'll be updating the code for upcoming updates also.
